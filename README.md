**Prerequisites**

* **fvm (Flutter Version Manager):** This tool helps manage multiple Flutter SDK versions efficiently. If you haven't installed it yet, follow the instructions on the fvm website ([https://pub.dev/packages/fvm](https://pub.dev/packages/fvm)).

**Flutter SDK Setup**

1. **Check Flutter SDK Version:**
   - Open a terminal window.
   - Run the following command to check your currently installed Flutter SDK version:

     ```bash
     flutter --version
     ```

2. **Install or Update Flutter SDK (if necessary):**
   - If you don't have Flutter installed or your version is older than 3.19.5, download the appropriate version for your operating system from the official Flutter website ([https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)).
   - If you already have Flutter but need to update, use fvm:

     ```bash
     fvm install <version>  # Replace `<version>` with the desired version (e.g., 3.19.5)
     fvm use <version>     # Activate the newly installed version
     ```

**Dart SDK Setup**

1. **Check Dart SDK Version:**
   - Run the following command in your terminal:

     ```bash
     dart --version
     ```

2. **Install or Update Dart SDK (if necessary):**
   - If you don't have the Dart SDK or your version is older than 3.3.3, download it from the official Dart SDK website ([https://dart.dev/get-dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart)).
   - If you already have Dart but need to update, follow the instructions provided on the website.

**Running the Project**

1. **Clone or Download the Project:**
   - If you haven't already, clone the project repository using Git or download the project files manually.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   - Open a terminal window and navigate to the root directory of your cloned or downloaded project.

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Run the following command in your terminal to install the project's dependencies:

     ```bash
     flutter pub get
     ```

4. **Run the App:**
   - To start the development server and launch the app on a connected device or emulator, use:

     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```

   - Alternatively, to run the app in web mode (assuming you have a web server set up):

     ```bash
     flutter run -d web
     ```
